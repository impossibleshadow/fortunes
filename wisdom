On Problems

Our choicest plans
  have fallen through
our airiest castles
  tumbled over
because of lines
  we neatly drew
and later neatly
  stumbled over.

T.T.T

Put up in a place
where it's easy to see

An Ethical Grook

I see
   and I hear
      and I speak no evil;
I carry
   no malice
      within my breast;
yet quite without
   wishing
      a man to the Devil
one may be
   permitted
      to hope for the best.

The Road to Wisdom

The road to wisdom? - Well, it's plain
and simple to express:
  Err
  and err
  and err again
  but less
  and less
  and less.

A Psychological Tip

Whenever you're called on to make up your mind,
  and you're hampered by not having any,
the best way to solve the dilemma, you'll find,
  is simply by spinning a penny.

No - not so that chance shall decide the affair
  while you're passively standing there moping;
but the moment the penny is up in the air,
  you suddenly know what you're hoping.

A Word to the Wise

Let the world pass in its time-ridden race;
  never get caught in its snare.
Remember, the only acceptable case
for being in any particular place
  is having no business there.

Meeting the Eye

You'll probably find
  that it suits your book
to be a bit cleverer
  than you look.

Observe that the easiest
  method by far
is to look a bit stupider
  than you are.
